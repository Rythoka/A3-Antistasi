# üëâ BASIC AND QUICK START üëà
0.  Run Arma 3.
1.  Make an empty mp-mission on any map (community or official) with just one player.
2.  Save and close the editor.
3.  Copy Everything in this folder (includes: /Collections/; /function/; /description.ext; /functions.hpp; /NG_importGUI.hpp)
4.  Paste into the folder of the mp mission you created. Usually in `C:\Users\User\Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\YOUR_ARMA_NAME\mpmissions\MISSION_NAME.MAP\`
5.  Start host LAN multiplayer.
6.  Run and join the mission.
7.  Press `Esc` on your keyboard to open debug console.
8.  Paste `[] spawn A3A_fnc_NG_main` into big large debug window.
9.  Click the button `Local Exec`.
10. Exit Debug Console, look down, and open map.
11. Wait for it to start drawing markers.
12. Open a new file.
13. Paste into the new file.
14. Save.

# üó∫ Generate navGridDB & Open Street Artist
Executing `[] spawn A3A_fnc_NG_main` will run with default settings.<br/>
Looking down gives the best performance during this process. You can lower render distance if it helps.<br/>
However, you may need to tweak some arguments depending on the simplification level required for the map.<br/>
### ‚öô A3A_fnc_NG_main Arguments:
1.  <SCALAR> Max drift is how far the simplified line segment can stray from the road in metres. (Default = 50)
2.  <SCALAR> Junctions are only merged if within this distance from each other. (Default = 15)
3.  <BOOLEAN> True to automatically start the StreetArtist Editor. (Default = true)

So running with default settings would also look like this `[50,15,true] spawn A3A_fnc_NG_main;`<br/>
To run with default and not edit use `[nil,nil,false] spawn A3A_fnc_NG_main;`<br/>
Max drift is not the only thing that affects road simplification: It will only simplify if the nearestTerrainObject from its position will still return one of it's neighbouring roads. This prevents virtual convoys that are trying to spawn vehicles from jumping to another nearby road because that is the closest navGrid node.<br/>
When starting the Street Artist editor and switch tools, in game help will display.

# üì• Import navGridDB & Open Street Artist
If you have already generated a navGridDB before loading the world and you do not want to regenerate it again: you can use the import function to load it into Arma 3 for viewing or editing.

1. Local exec `[] spawn A3A_fnc_NGSA_main` in the debug console.
2. Press `Continue` to close debug console. (If you press `Esc`, you will close the import dialogue!)
3. Switch to real-life and open the navGridDB file and Copy everything.
4. Switch to Arma 3 and paste it into the editBox and press the the import button.<br/>
When starting the Street Artist editor and switch tools, in game help will display.

# üìç Customise Marker Size and Colours
**Run after you have generated a navGrid or have imported one.**<br/>
To draw markers with default settings run `[] spawn A3A_fnc_NG_draw_main;`<br/>
You can re-run this command as much as you want, everytime it will delete the old markers and redraw new. (But please wait for the last one to finish otherwise bad things will happen.)<br/>

### ‚öô Here are some settings which you can tweak:
1.  <SCALAR> Thickness of line, 1-high density, 4-normal, 8-Stratis world view, 16-Seattle world view. (Set to 0 to disable) (Default = 4)
2.  <BOOLEAN> False if line partially transparent, true if solid and opaque. (Default = false)
3.  <BOOLEAN> True to draw distance between road segments. (Only draws if above 5m) (Default = false)
4.  <SCALAR> Size of road node dots. (Set to 0 to disable) (Default = 0.8)
5.  <SCALAR> Size of island dots. (Set to 0 to disable) (Default = 1.5)

Therefore, the default execution would also look like this: `[4,false,false,0.8,1] spawn A3A_fnc_NG_draw_main;`<br/>
You will need to update these variables if using street artist editor:<br/>
`A3A_NGSA_dotBaseSize = 1.2;`<br/>
`A3A_NGSA_lineBaseSize = 4;`<br/>

### üÜì Presets:
* Inspect road network overview `[6,true,false,0,1] spawn A3A_fnc_NG_draw_main;`
* Inspect Junctions `[1,false,false,0.4,0.8] spawn A3A_fnc_NG_draw_main;`
* Only road dots and islands: `[0,false,false,0.8,1] spawn A3A_fnc_NG_draw_main;`
* Only large lines and distances: `[6,false,true,0,0] spawn A3A_fnc_NG_draw_main;`
